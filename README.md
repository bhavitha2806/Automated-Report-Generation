DESCRIPTION:

The objective is to create a Python script that reads data from a structured file, such as a CSV, performs analysis, and generates a professional PDF report using libraries like FPDF or ReportLab. The script should automate the process of transforming raw data into meaningful insights by calculating key statistics such as averages, counts, and distributions. This not only streamlines reporting but also eliminates the need for manual documentation, ensuring efficiency and consistency. In this task, a sample dataset representing employee details—such as name, age, salary, and department—is used to demonstrate functionality. The script reads the data using pandas, analyzes it using built-in methods like describe() to obtain summary statistics, and outputs the results into a well-formatted PDF report using the FPDF library. The final deliverables include the Python script that performs the analysis and generates the report, a sample CSV file with test data, and the resulting PDF report. This task strengthens skills in file handling, data analysis, and dynamic document creation, all of which are essential in modern data-driven applications.
